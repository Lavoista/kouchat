#summary The road ahead for KouChat

= Roadmap =

This is my current plan for the future of KouChat. Don't rely on this plan! It can and probably will change, but I thought some of you might be interested in the road ahead. No dates and priorities are set, and that's on purpose. It's done when it's done :)

If you have any suggestions, please use the issue tracker.

 * Multi-line messages (issue 12)
 * Make the system tray icon optional
 * Clickable links in the about dialog
 * Direct TCP/IP connection to users
 * Switch to json as transport format
 * Point to point encryption (issue 4)
 * Send all files in folder
 * Only see users in specified group/chat room
 * Improve console mode with ANSI, to get tab completion, colors and user list (issue 26)
 * Internationalization (issue 27)
