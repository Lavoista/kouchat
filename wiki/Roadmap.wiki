= Roadmap =

This is my current plan for the future of KouChat. Don't rely on this plan! It can and probably will change, but I thought some of you might be interested in the road ahead. No dates are set, and that's on purpose. It's done when it's done :)

If you have any suggestions, please use the issue tracker.
