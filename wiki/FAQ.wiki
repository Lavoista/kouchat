= Frequently Asked Questions =


==== 1. What is Kou? ====

Kou is a special cow character I've made. You can see Kou at the [http://superkou.googlecode.com/ Super Kou] project page. Kou is pronounced kind of like the way cows say _moooo_, but it's OK to just call him Cow.


==== 2. KouChat crashed, doesn't connect, or behaves strangely. ====

First, make sure you are using the latest version. When you do, the easiest way to find the problem is for you to run KouChat from the console, like this: _java -jar kouchat-x.x.x.jar_.
If you see any errors, write them down. If nothing of interest shows up, then you can try enabling debug output by running KouChat like this: _java -jar kouchat-x.x.x.jar --debug_.

Please check the other wiki pages for help as well. When you can reproduce the problem, report it as an issue on this project page with as many details as possible.


==== 3. I minimized KouChat, and it's not visible on the taskbar anymore. ====

Have a look in the system tray. There should be a small black and white icon there with a cow pattern. Click on it to open KouChat again.


==== 4. How do I change my nick name? ====

Open the _Tools_ menu, and choose _Settings_.


==== 5. How do I send files? ====

Right click on a user in the user list on the right side, and choose _"Send file"_. You can also drag and drop a file on a user in the list, or in a private chat window.


==== 6. How do I open a private chat? ====

You can double click on a user in the user list, or you can right click on a user in the user list and choose _"Private chat"_.


==== 7. The file chooser is horribly slow in Windows XP. ====

This is a Java bug, see http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6578753. As a workaround you can move any zip-files lying on the desktop to some other folder.


==== 8. How do I enable console mode? ====

From a console, run KouChat like this: _java -jar kouchat-x.x.x.jar --console_. See _/help_ for a list of commands you can use while in console mode.


==== 9. How come some messages don't show up in other clients? ====

That's probably because of packet loss. KouChat uses the UDP protocol, which does not resend lost packets. Packet loss is usually not a problem in wired networks, but wireless networks might have some loss.


==== 10. Where do the log files go? ====

The logs are put in the _~/.kouchat/logs/_ folder, sorted by date and time of creation. For those wondering, ~ means home folder.

Examples:

  * *Windows XP* - _C:\Documents and Settings\Your Username\.kouchat\logs\_
  * *Windows Vista* - _C:\Users\Your Username\.kouchat\logs\_
  * *Linux* - _/home/username/.kouchat/logs/_


==== 11. Why do non-ascii characters look wrong when using console mode in Windows? ====

That's because the Windows console uses the old DOS character sets instead of the normal Windows character sets. A common DOS charset is cp850 and a common Windows charset is cp1252. I've found 2 ways to go around this problem:

  # Change the console charset to match the Windows charset. If your Windows charset is cp1252, just run the command _chcp 1252_ before starting KouChat like normal. For this to work you need a console font which supports the chosen charset, like _Lucida Console_.
  # Change the Java charset to match the console charset. You can get the current console charset by running the command _chcp_. Then use the charset number when starting KouChat: _java -Dfile.encoding=850 -jar kouchat-x.x.x.jar --console_.


==== 12. Why don't I have the Nimbus look and feel? ====

Nimbus is a new look and feel that comes with Java 6 update 10 and newer.
If you don't see Nimbus in the list, then you need to update to the
newest version of Java.


==== 13. Where can I find an icon to use for shortcuts? ====

There is an icon available inside _kouchat-x.x.x.jar_, in two different
formats:

  * kou_shortcut.ico
  * kou_shortcut.png

To find these, you can just open the jar file in a decompression utility
like WinZip or 7-Zip.


==== 14. Which smileys are available? ====

==== 15. Why is the window sometimes only maximized vertically or horizontally after being unhidden from the system tray? ====

I don't know! But I'm unable to reproduce the problem using early versions of Java 7, so I'm guessing it's not my bug ;)


==== 16. I have a great suggestion for a new feature. What do I do? ====

Cool :) Just register the suggestion on the issue tracker with "_feature request_" in the title.


==== 17. KouChat uses the wrong network interface. How can I switch? ====

Typical use cases include:

 * You want to connect to the wired network by default, but KouChat keeps connecting to the wireless network.
 * KouChat connects using a "fake" network interface that ships with virtualization software like VMware and Virtual Box.

You can override the network interface chosen by KouChat in the settings.
Choose one in the list and click OK to switch. Tip: hold the mouse over
each of the items in the drop down list for more details about the network
interface, if available.


==== 18. How can I get KouChat to open in front of other applications after being unhidden from the system tray in KDE? ====

The window manager in KDE is usually configured with a feature called
_Focus stealing prevention_. This feature keeps new windows from opening
in front and stealing focus. However, when unhiding KouChat from the
system tray it's because one wants to interact with that window, and this
focus stealing prevention gets in the way.

It can be disabled globally or per application. Here is how to disable for
KouChat only:

Right click on the title bar of the KouChat window, then click on
_Advanced/Special Application Settings..._. Go to the rightmost tab,
called something like _Workarounds_ or _Appearance & Fixes_
(depends on the version of KDE). Enable the checkbox on
_Focus stealing prevention_, and set it to _Force_ and _None_ in the 2
drop down lists, then click OK to save.


==== 19. Which ports do I need to have open in the firewall? ====

If your firewall is blocking network traffic then KouChat will show the text
"Not connected" in the title bar. The following ports needs to be open for
everything to work correctly:

 * Main chat: UDP port 40556
 * Private chat: UDP port 40656 (increased by one for each running instance)
 * File transfer: TCP port 40756
 * Network detection: UDP port 50050
