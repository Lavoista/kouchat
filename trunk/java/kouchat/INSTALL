- KouChat v0.9.5 INSTALL

There are 2 ways to compile KouChat. The easy way, and the easiest way :)


* The easiest way

The easiest way is by using Maven. If you don't have Maven, download
from http://maven.apache.org/

To compile, stay in the root folder where pom.xml is, and run:
'mvn'

That's it! You should have a ready-to-use kouchat-0.9.5.jar file
in the target folder.


* The easy way

The easy way is more manual. To run these commands,
you need to be in the src folder.

To compile the source:
'javac net/usikkert/kouchat/KouChat.java'

To run the program:
'java net.usikkert.kouchat.KouChat'

To make a jar file:
'jar cvmf ../manifest.txt kouchat-0.9.5.jar net/usikkert/kouchat/*.class net/usikkert/kouchat/*/*.class net/usikkert/kouchat/*/*/*.class icons/*.png error.wav -C .. README -C .. COPYING -C .. FAQ'

In Windows, you might need to change '/' with '\' and ':' with ';'
and possibly more ;)


Have fun! :)
