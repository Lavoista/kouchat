- KouChat v0.6.1

A simple chat program for local networks, without the need for a server.

This program is written in Java, so if you don't have Java installed,
go to http://java.sun.com/ and download Java SE 6.0.

You only need the JRE to run KouChat.
To compile the source, you need the full JDK.

If you downloaded the src package, see INSTALL.

To run: 'java -jar KouChat.jar'

A good advice: make a shortcut, batch file or shell script to start the program.
In Windows, use 'javaw' instead of 'java' to avoid the DOS box that pops up.

Enjoy :)
