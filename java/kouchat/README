KouChat is a simple chat program for local networks, without the need for a server.

go to http://java.sun.com/ and download Java SE 6.0 or newer.

You only need the JRE to run KouChat.
To compile the source, you need the full JDK.

If you downloaded the src package, see INSTALL.

To run: 'java -jar KouChat.jar'

Enjoy :)
