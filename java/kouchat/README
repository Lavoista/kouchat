KouChat is a simple serverless chat client for local area networks.
It's written in Java, and is free software.

If you don't have Java installed, go to
http://www.java.com/ and download Java SE 6 Runtime Environment.

KouChat can usually be started by clicking on the kouchat-1.1.0.jar file,
just like any other application.

You can also start KouChat from the console: 'java -jar kouchat-1.1.0.jar'

Enjoy :)
