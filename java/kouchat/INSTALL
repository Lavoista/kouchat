- KouChat v0.9.9 INSTALL

The recommended way to build KouChat is by using Maven.
If you don't have Maven, download from http://maven.apache.org/

To compile, stay in the root folder where pom.xml is, and run:
'mvn'

That's it! You should have a ready-to-use kouchat-0.9.9.jar file
in the target folder.

Have fun! :)
